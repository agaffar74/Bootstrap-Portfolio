# Bootstrap-Portfolio

This Bootstrap-Portfolio has been developped by me as part of my course assignment.

My Work
I have built a portfolio using bootstrap, HTMl and CSS, which can be addded to as the course progresses.

I believe a portfolio of work can showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position.

The Functionality of this webpage
When the page is loaded the page presents my name, a recent photo of mine, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me
When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
When viewing the section about my work then the section contains titled images of my applications
When presented with the my first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
